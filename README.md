Step 1: Accept the assignment created in order to create your repository.

Step 2: Clone the remote repository to your local machine. This will allow you to add customizable HTML static
pages with CSS. When cloning the repository, be sure to follow the proper structure to avoid issues with
pushing changes later in the lesson. Additionally, you need to configure Git in your local repository by setting
your username and email. This configuration helps track who pushes changes to the remote Git repository.

Step 3: Change the visibility of your Git repository to public, then configure GitHub Pages through the settings
by selecting which part of the branch you will use to host your static website.

HTML and CSS are fun and intuitive!
